/*
Arrays: In contrast to variables, an array can store multiple values. 
Each value in an array has an index, and each index has a reference in 
a memory address. Each value can be accessed by using their indexes. 
The index of an array starts from zero, and the index of the last 
element is less by one from the length of the array.

An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and 
changeable(modifiable). An array allows storing duplicate elements and 
different data types. An array can be empty, or it may have different 
data type values.
