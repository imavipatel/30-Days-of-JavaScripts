Day 8 : Scope

Variable is the fundamental part in programming. We declare variable to store different data types. 
To declare a variable we use the key word var, let and const. A variable can be declared at different scope. 
In this section, we will see the scope variables, scope of variables when we use var or let. 
Variables scopes can be:

Global

Local

Variable can be declared globally or locally scope. We will see both global and local scope. 
Anything declared without let, var or const is scoped at global level.

Let us imagine that we have a scope.js file.
