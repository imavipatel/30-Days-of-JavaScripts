//5. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

//The slope of a linear equation in the form y = mx + b is the coefficient of x, which is m.

let yearsOld = todaysDate.getFullYear()-bornYear

//13 Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years

let yearToLive = prompt('Enter the number of years you live:')
